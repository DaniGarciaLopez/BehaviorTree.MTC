# BehaviorTree.MTC

**This project is still in an early development phase.**

This project is compatible with version 4.X of [BehaviorTree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP).

It is recommanded that the [Moveit Task Constructor](https://github.com/moveit/moveit_task_constructor) library commit version `>=` [fdc06c3](https://github.com/moveit/moveit_task_constructor/commit/fdc06c3b9105dadec2f44ee3e4b3133986945e86). This is to ensure that one can preempt a plan gracefully.

## Roadmap
We plan to release version `1.0.0` by the end of summer 2024. Check the [roadmap](https://github.com/captain-yoshi/BehaviorTree.MTC/issues/15) for more details.
